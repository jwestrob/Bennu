## Expected Issues by Category:
# BGC Integration: GECCO data not properly linked, product prediction failures
# Transport Annotation: Missing KEGG transport terms, conflicting classifications
# Pathway Reconstruction: Incomplete pathway mapping, missing enzyme handling
# CPR Genome Handling: System assumptions breaking on minimal genomes
# Cross-Annotation Conflicts: Same protein with conflicting functional assignments
# Large Result Management: Performance issues, memory problems, compression failures
# Coordinate Systems: Gene location analysis, operon prediction problems
# Schema Integration: Multi-database conflicts, relationship mapping issues

## Success Criteria:
# - All BGC queries return actual product types (not "Unknown")
# - Transport queries use both KEGG and PFAM data appropriately
# - Comparative queries show all genomes without inappropriate LIMIT clauses
# - CPR genomes handled gracefully without system crashes
# - Large datasets compressed intelligently without losing critical information
# - Genomic coordinates and clustering work correctly
# - Cross-database annotations integrated without conflicts
