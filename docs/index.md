# Microbial Claude Matter: Genomic AI Platform

**Transform microbial genome assemblies into intelligent, queryable knowledge graphs with LLM-powered biological insights.**

## Overview

This is a next-generation genomic intelligence platform that combines traditional bioinformatics workflows with AI agents and embedding-based vector similarity search. The system processes genome assemblies through an 8-stage pipeline culminating in an intelligent question-answering system capable of sophisticated biological analysis.

### Key Achievements

- **373,587 RDF triples** linking genomes, proteins, domains, and functions
- **1,845 CAZymes + 813 KEGG orthologs** with authoritative functional descriptions  
- **Enhanced GECCO BGC integration** with 17 quantitative properties per BGC
- **10,102 proteins** with 320-dimensional ESM2 semantic embeddings
- **Sub-millisecond vector similarity search** with LanceDB
- **Production-ready Neo4j integration** with 48K nodes and 95K relationships
- **High-confidence biological insights** using DSPy-powered RAG system

## Quick Start

```bash
# Activate environment
source /Users/jacob/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-latest/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate genome-kg

# Run complete pipeline
python -m src.cli build

# Ask questions about your genomic data
python -m src.cli ask "What transport proteins are present in the database?"
python -m src.cli ask "Show me the distribution of CAZyme types among each genome"
python -m src.cli ask "Find proteins similar to heme transporters"
```

## Example Output

```
ðŸ§¬ Processing question: Show me the distribution of CAZyme types among each genome in the dataset; compare and contrast.

ðŸ¤– Answer:
Overview
Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) fall into several functional classes: glycoside hydrolases (GH), 
glycosyltransferases (GT), carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM), carbohydrate esterases (CE), 
polysaccharide lyases (PL) and auxiliary activities (AA). Comparing four genomes reveals clear 
differences in both repertoire size and functional emphasis.

Per-genome CAZyme profiles
1. Burkholderiales_bacterium: 1,056 CAZymes
   â€¢ GH 436 (41.3%), GT 356 (33.7%), CBM 163 (15.4%), AA 56 (5.3%)
   â€¢ Interpretation: GH-rich toolkit suggests specialization for aggressive breakdown of diverse 
     plant-derived polysaccharides

2. PLM0_60_b1_sep16: 425 CAZymes  
   â€¢ GT 178 (41.9%), GH 156 (36.7%), CBM 53 (12.5%)
   â€¢ Interpretation: GT emphasis indicates investment in cell-wall/EPS biosynthesis
