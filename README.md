```
Protein RIFCSPHIGHO2_scaffold_21_154 (155,952-156,470 bp, ‚Äì strand): 
A succinyl-CoA synthetase Œ±-subunit gene begins 3 bp downstream (central TCA enzyme), 
and an AraC regulator is 27 bp downstream; photinus-luciferin monooxygenase starts 7 bp upstream.

Sequence Analysis: Contains conserved "GGVGPN" motif typical of TctB family transporters.
Hydropathy analysis shows 53.2% hydrophobic residues with 4-5 predicted transmembrane helices.
Signal peptide detected with probable cleavage between ALA‚ÜìWGA (24/25).

Biological Significance: This tricarboxylate transporter enables import of TCA cycle 
intermediates, with genomic clustering suggesting coordinated regulation of central metabolism.
```

### **Comparative Genomics**
```
Functional analysis reveals three paralogous TctB transporters (163-324 aa; hydropathy 53-63%) 
suggesting adaptation to different organic-acid niches. The presence of multiple variants 
enables robust central-carbon flux through the TCA cycle under varying nutrient conditions.

## Example prompts and outputs

- Prompt: "Show me the distribution of CAZymes among each genome in the dataset; compare and contrast." 
- Output: 
```
ü§ñ Answer:
Overview
Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) fall into several functional classes: glycoside hydrolases (GH, hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates), glycosyltransferases (GT, biosynthetic transfer of sugar moieties), carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM, 
substrate targeting), carbohydrate esterases (CE, removal of acetyl/other esters), polysaccharide lyases (PL, Œ≤-elimination cleavage) and auxiliary activities (AA, redox enzymes that boost lignocellulose degradation).  Comparing four genomes 
reveals clear differences in both repertoire size and functional emphasis.

Per-genome CAZyme profiles
1. Burkholderiales_bacterium_RIFCSPHIGHO2_01_FULL_64_960
   ‚Ä¢ Total CAZymes: 1 056
   ‚Ä¢ GH 436 (41.3%), GT 356 (33.7%), CBM 163 (15.4%), AA 56 (5.3%), CE 34, PL 10, Unknown 1
   Interpretation: A very large, GH-rich toolkit accompanied by many CBMs suggests an organism specialised for aggressive breakdown of diverse plant-derived polysaccharides and efficient substrate binding.  The sizeable AA complement indicates
oxidative support for lignocellulose attack.

2. PLM0_60_b1_sep16_Maxbin2_047
   ‚Ä¢ Total CAZymes: 425
   ‚Ä¢ GT 178 (41.9%), GH 156 (36.7%), CBM 53 (12.5%), CE 24, AA 13, PL 1
   Interpretation: Similar overall size to genome 2 but inverted emphasis: slightly more GTs than GHs points to a greater investment in cell-wall/ EPS biosynthesis or glycan remodelling rather than pure hydrolysis.  A single PL hints at 
limited pectate/alginate degradation capacity.

3. Candidatus_Muproteobacteria_bacterium_RIFCSPHIGHO2_01_FULL_61_200
   ‚Ä¢ Total CAZymes: 264
   ‚Ä¢ GH 105 (39.8%), GT 103 (39.0%), CBM 42 (15.9%), CE 7, AA 6, Unknown 1
   Interpretation: Mid-sized repertoire with nearly 1:1 GH:GT ratio; capable of both glycan synthesis and moderate degradation.  Fewer AAs/CEs suggest less capacity for recalcitrant biomass turnover compared with Burkholderiales.

4. Candidatus_Nomurabacteria_bacterium_RIFCSPLOWO2_01_FULL_41_220
   ‚Ä¢ Total CAZymes: 100
   ‚Ä¢ GH 43 (43%), GT 42 (42%), CBM 10 (10%), CE 3, AA 2
   Interpretation: The smallest genome and CAZyme complement in the set.  Balanced but low absolute GH/GT numbers indicate a limited niche‚Äîperhaps scavenging small oligosaccharides rather than degrading bulk polysaccharide.

Key contrasts
‚Ä¢ Repertoire size spans >10-fold (100 vs 1 056 CAZymes).  Burkholderiales clearly stands out as a carbohydrate-degrader, whereas Nomurabacteria appears streamlined.
‚Ä¢ GH dominance vs GT dominance: Burkholderiales (GH-heavy) likely secretes an extensive hydrolytic arsenal, while PLM0_60_b1 (GT-heavy) invests more in glycan assembly/modification‚Äîpossibly for biofilm or capsule formation.
‚Ä¢ CBM support: High CBM counts in Burkholderiales reinforce a plant-biomass lifestyle; lower counts in others reflect reduced need for tight substrate binding.
‚Ä¢ Auxiliary redox enzymes (AA) are most abundant in Burkholderiales, enabling oxidative cleavage of lignin-like compounds; minimal in Nomurabacteria, suggesting reliance on already-processed carbohydrates.
‚Ä¢ Polysaccharide lyases are found only in Burkholderiales and PLM0_60_b1, indicating that pectin/alginate degradation capacity is restricted to these two genomes.

Biological implications
The data outline a possible trophic hierarchy: Burkholderiales may act as a primary degrader in its environment, opening complex plant polymers for the community.  The Muproteobacteria and PLM0_60 genomes could serve as secondary 
consumers‚Äîeither continuing hydrolysis or synthesising extracellular polysaccharides.  Nomurabacteria seems adapted to utilising simpler sugars released by others.

Such functional partitioning is common in soil and rhizosphere microbiomes, where synergy between hydrolytic specialists and organisms focused on biosynthesis or scavenging underpins efficient carbon cycling.

- Prompt: python3 -m src.cli ask "Tell me everything you can reasonably conclude about the metabolism and lifestyle of Candidatus_Nomurabacteria_bacterium_RIFCSPLOWO2_01_FULL_41_220.contigs (genome id)"
- Output:
```
ü§ñ Answer:
Below is a genome-scale ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù of what can be inferred for  
Candidatus Nomurabacteria bacterium RIFCSPLOWO2_01_FULL_41_220.contigs.

1. General genome characteristics  
‚Ä¢ 305 KEGG Orthologous (KO) functions ‚Äì very low for free-living bacteria, typical of Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) organisms that have streamlined genomes (often ‚â§1 Mb).  
‚Ä¢ GC content ‚âà 40 % (Step 1) ‚Äì moderate/low.  
‚Ä¢ 95 CAZyme-annotated proteins but only 18 predicted transporters (Step 5) ‚Äì suggests ability to hydrolyse extracellular carbohydrates yet a limited membrane protein repertoire, again consistent with CPR.  
‚Ä¢ No biosynthetic gene clusters, CRISPR arrays or other defence systems detected (Step 8).

2. Central carbon metabolism  
Detected glycolytic enzymes (sample KOs, Step 9):  
‚ÄÉK01689 (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase)  
‚ÄÉK01869 (GAPDH)  
‚ÄÉK01887 (phosphoglycerate kinase)  
‚ÄÉK01876 (enolase)  
‚Üí an almost complete Embden‚ÄìMeyerhof glycolysis is present, enabling substrate-level ATP generation from hexoses.

No genes for the tricarboxylic-acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation complexes, ATP synthase or alternative respiratory complexes were recovered.  Hence energy conservation is most likely limited to fermentation.

3. Carbon acquisition  
‚Ä¢ 95 CAZymes span glycoside hydrolase (GH), glycosyl-transferase (GT), carbohydrate-binding (CBM) and other families (Step 5 & 9).  
  ‚Äì GH3 & GH16 families (seen in Step 2 for related scaffolds) typically target Œ≤-glucans, cello-oligosaccharides and laminarin.  
  ‚Äì Presence of these enzymes, together with even a small number of transporters, points to uptake of simple sugars/oligosaccharides released after extracellular hydrolysis.

‚Ä¢ No CO‚ÇÇ-fixing pathways or autotrophic markers (RuBisCO, Wood‚ÄìLjungdahl, etc.; Step 5), so the organism is an obligate heterotroph.

4. Nitrogen, sulfur, and other inorganic metabolisms  
Searches in Steps 6‚Äì7 returned no nitrogen fixation, nitrification/denitrification, dissimilatory sulfur or sulfide oxidation genes for this genome. Assimilatory pathways are probably incomplete, implying environmental or host-derived sources 
of reduced nitrogen/sulfur compounds.

5. Biosynthetic capacities and potential auxotrophies  
Small CPR genomes characteristically lack full amino-acid, nucleotide and cofactor biosynthetic pathways. The limited KO set here contains primarily core informational machinery (rpo, ftsZ, secA, ribosomal proteins, etc.) but few anabolic 
enzymes, indicating extensive dependence on exogenous metabolites.

6. Stress response, motility, interaction traits  
No chemotaxis, flagellar, secretion, toxin, defence or CRISPR elements were identified (Steps 7‚Äì8).  Coupled with the low transporter count, this suggests a sedentary, host- or community-associated lifestyle rather than an actively motile 
free-living cell.

7. Ecological and lifestyle model  
Taken together, the data support the following scenario:  
‚Ä¢ An anaerobic/micro-aerophilic, carbohydrate-fermenting bacterium that relies on substrate-level phosphorylation.  
‚Ä¢ Streamlined genome and minimal biosynthetic repertoire imply an obligate symbiotic or episymbiotic lifestyle, scavenging amino acids, vitamins and nucleotides from neighbouring microbes or a eukaryotic host.  
‚Ä¢ The CAZyme complement allows it to hydrolyse environmental or host-derived polysaccharides to short sugars it can ferment.  
‚Ä¢ Lack of defence systems and motility hints that it occupies a protected niche (e.g., inside biofilms, on host surfaces, or in subsurface sediments).

These features are consistent with published observations for Nomurabacteria and other CPR members, which are frequently found in groundwater, sediments and animal microbiomes as ultra-small, metabolically reduced symbionts.

- Prompt: python3 -m src.cli ask "Find me operons containing probable prophage segments; we don't have virus-specific annotations so read through everything directly and see what you can find. Large stretches of unannotated/hypothetical proteins are good signals for phage\!"
- Output:
```ü§ñ Answer:
Below are genomic regions that stand out as likely prophage islands / operons based purely on the pattern of long consecutive runs of ‚Äúhypothetical protein‚Äù calls in the supplied annotation lists.  Because no virus-specific annotation was 
included, the inference is based on (i) ‚â•5‚Äì10 adjacent genes with no functional assignment, (ii) occasional presence of phage-hallmark terms (e.g. ‚Äúintegrase‚Äù, ‚Äúrecombinase‚Äù, ‚Äúportal‚Äù) when they do appear in the vicinity in most prokaryotic 
genomes, and (iii) scaffolds that carry several such clusters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Burkholderiales_bacterium_RIFCSPHIGHO2_01_FULL_64_960_contigs  
   a. Scaffold_21 : genes rifcsphigho2_01_scaffold_21_172 ‚Üí _186  
      ‚Ä¢ At least 5 consecutive genes (_172, _182, _186 and neighboring ORFs) are annotated only as ‚Äúhypothetical protein‚Äù.  
      ‚Ä¢ Up-stream and downstream on the same scaffold additional hypotheticals (_162-_188 range) form a block of ‚â•12 genes.  
      ‚Ä¢ Size estimate ~12‚Äì14 kb ‚Äì typical for a phage structural gene cassette.

   b. Scaffold_9 : genes rifcsphigho2_01_scaffold_9_11 ‚Üí _45 (and _297-_371)  
      ‚Ä¢ Two separate islands on the same scaffold:  
        ‚Äì Early section (_11, 20, 40, 45) contains ‚â•8 hypothetical proteins in a 10 kb window.  
        ‚Äì Later section (_297, 297-_371) again shows ‚â•6 consecutive hypotheticals.  
      ‚Ä¢ Split arrangement suggests a prophage whose modules (integration and lysis vs. structural) separated by host genes ‚Äì a common arrangement after recombination.

   c. Scaffold_64 and Scaffold_84 each list ‚â•6 hypothetical proteins in a ~15 kb stretch, giving two additional candidate tail-fiber / lysis gene cassettes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PLM0_60_b1_sep16_Maxbin2_047_curated_contigs  
   a. Scaffold_2979_curated : genes _6, 8, 10 (plus neighboring ORFs)  
      ‚Ä¢ Block of at least 7 genes, >80 % hypothetical.  
      ‚Ä¢ In many assemblies, the 3‚Ä≤ end of the block contains a tyrosine-recombinase or integrase gene (often still called ‚Äúhypothetical‚Äù) ‚Äì worth checking.

   b. Scaffold_1206_curated : genes _5-_13  
      ‚Ä¢ Nine consecutive loci, all hypothetical.  
      ‚Ä¢ Length estimate 9‚Äì11 kb; could represent head-tail morphogenesis operon.

   c. Scaffold_945_curated : genes _17 and surrounding region show 10+ hypotheticals ‚Äì another strong prophage candidate.

   d. Smaller islands on scaffolds 1092, 19811 and 27420 show 5‚Äì6 hypotheticals each; possible partial or remnant phage regions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Candidatus_Nomurabacteria_bacterium_RIFCSPLOWO2_01_FULL_41_220_contigs  
   a. Scaffold_1705 : genes _21, 26, 55, 57, 62, 108  
      ‚Ä¢ This scaffold alone lists >15 hypothetical proteins distributed over ~50 kb.  
      ‚Ä¢ The dense cluster from _55 to _62 (‚â•8 hypotheticals in a row) resembles a structural module.  
      ‚Ä¢ Additional hypotheticals up-stream (_21‚Äì_26) are consistent with regulatory/integration modules.

   b. Scaffold_1837 : genes _22‚Äì_42 (‚â•10 hypothetical) ‚Äì heavy enrichment for unknown proteins; attractive prophage island.

   c. Scaffold_11661 and 2268 both carry smaller clusters (5‚Äì7 loci) that could be satellite phage remnants or cargo genes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Candidatus_Muproteobacteria_bacterium_RIFCSPHIGHO2_01_FULL_61_200_contigs  
   a. Scaffold_33076 : genes _6, 8 (and neighbors) ‚Äì 6+ contiguous hypotheticals.  
   b. Scaffold_33432 : genes _8-_15 ‚Äì ‚â•8 hypotheticals suggest a full tail / baseplate operon.  
   c. Scaffold_21567 : genes _8-_9 and flanks ‚Äì compact block of unknowns, possible integration module.  
   d. Scaffold_58499 plus 34381 each show runs of 5‚Äì7 hypothetical proteins; likely partial phage regions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biological interpretation & next steps  
‚Ä¢ Long uninterrupted blocks of ‚Äúhypothetical protein‚Äù genes are uncommon in core bacterial metabolism but are typical of integrated prophages, whose structural and lytic genes often lack precise functional calls in automated pipelines.  
‚Ä¢ The candidate loci above show the length (5‚Äì20 kb) and clustering pattern expected for phage head-tail gene cassettes, integrase modules, or lysis cassettes.  
‚Ä¢ Confirmatory analyses:  
  ‚Äì Run each scaffold through PHASTER/PHAST or VIBRANT to detect phage hallmark domains (capsid, terminase, portal, tail fiber, holin, endolysin).  
  ‚Äì Check for attL/attR attachment sequences at scaffold boundaries.  
  ‚Äì Examine GC-content deviation relative to host chromosome; prophage regions often display distinct GC skew.

If validated, these prophage operons could influence host fitness via lysogenic conversion, provide defense islands (anti-CRISPRs, RM systems), or act as mobile genetic elements for horizontal gene transfer.
